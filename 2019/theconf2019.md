## Title
Going Beyond Unit Tests: Taking Your Testing Strategy To The Next Level With Mutation Testing

## Abstract

Unit tests are awesome. They lead to cleaner, uncoupled software design. They help you catch bugs before they turn into bigger problems. Most important of all, they increase the confidence of the developers, encouraging them to fearlessly refactor the code, with the knowledge that the tests will warn you if they break anything. Would unit tests be the legendary silver bullet?

Unfortunately, just having unit tests is not enough. Are your tests good enough? Are they right? Do they cover 100% of the production code? Does that matter?

In this talk, I'm going to show you the answer to all of the questions above. And that answer would be: mutation testing. You're going to learn about how mutation testing is the missing piece of the puzzle. Mutation testing can increase your confidence on your own tests, help you reap the benefits of TDD even if you write your tests after the production code, and turn code coverage into a meaningful metric once again.

## About The Conference

THE CONF is the first tech conference in Brazil to be delivered exclusively in English. The goal of the event is to showcase the talent and expertise of Latin-American developers, by presenting in English and that way bridging the gap between Latin-America and the rest of the world.
